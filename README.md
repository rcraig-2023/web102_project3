# Web Development Project 3 - *Food Vocabulary in Spanish*

Submitted by: **Rica Craig**

This web app: **I created an app that allows users to test their knowledge of Spanish food vocabulary.**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The user can enter their guess in a box before seeing the flipside of the card**
- [x] **Clicking on a submit button shows visual feedback about whether the answer was correct or incorrect**
- [x] **A back button is displayed on the card and can be used to return to the previous card in a set sequence**
- [x] **A next button is displayed on the card and can be used to navigate to the next card in a set sequence**

NOTE: It may be hard to spot in the video, but when the guess is correct, the border of the guess fieldbox turns blue; if the guess is incorrect, it changes to red.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] A shuffle button is used to randomize the order of the cards
- [ ] A user's answer may be counted as correct even when it is slightly different from the target answer
- [ ] A counter displays the user's current and longest streak of correct responses
- [ ] A user can mark a card that they have mastered and have it removed from the pool of answers as well as added to a list of mastered cards

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I encountered some challenges resolving an issue where clicking on a flashcard caused the app to transition to the next one.
- It took some effort to adjust the spacing between the flashcard elements to ensure nothing overlapped.
